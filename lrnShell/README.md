# TIL: Shell Scripting

### 11/07/2022

Following the course provided by EDX, I could refresh my mind about some concepts of linux, all the basics knowledge of system operations, scripting, file handling, etc etc. 
I'm taking a little more time which I desired to finish, but I am enjoying the experience, it's the kinda of thing I always wanted to learn.
