# Journal

## Why?

When I was a kid, I really loved to write journals, I wrote a bunch of them, and one of my reasons was I could be able to read in the future and remember of remarkable things which happened with me, then I grew up, read some of them, then I realized how stupid I was, and how those things forged me as a both strong and emotional person, which felt a little bit of everything and learned by therefrom. And that is, _I realized I changed for good, I saw it happening through the time, and I felt joy and proud of myself_, it's really magical, and I want to rescue this habit, in another level, with another kind of goal.

My lessons and my improvements can't be limited to coding, soft skills and those things, I also must track my personal improvements, specially the things which is most meaningfull to me, to remember who I was and all things I could done for myself, all my achievements, all I had to fight against and win to reach my goals. 
This directory can be the most unuseful to most of the people interested in see coding and actual projects, but for me, it's the most important part of all, the soul of my efforts, my tiny dose of reality of how I am growing.
