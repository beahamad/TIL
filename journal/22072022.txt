Today, 22/07/2022, I learned...

16h34: Like my love says: I'm in dangerrrr...
So, I'm out of connection at home by FOUR FUCKING DAYS counting w/ today,  it's being a huge pain in the ass, forcing me to sleep all night, not making almost any progress in studies bc the shitty mobile data and lack of produtivity, and I realized I don't have just Concurrent and Prob in schedule for next week, but all the disciplines. Yeah. Every fucking goddamn discipline, the week tests from Security, Network Project, minitest of ATAL, ACTUAL TEST of ATAL, PRACTICE TEST OF ATAL, EVERYTHING!!!!! I'M IN TROUBLE, I'M FREAKING OUT, AND I'M WITHOUT CONNECTIVITY!!!!!!!!!!!
OH GOD I'M GOIN TO MORB ANY MINUTE. But I'm here to point a plan of contention. I HAVE TO FOLLOW THE PLAN AT ANY COST.

WHAT DO WE HAVE:

CONCURRENT: 
	- I have the slides on iPad, I have the class records in audio, I must have to use it the best way I can.
	- I must have to write every single question to be answered at tuesday. Mandatorily.
	- I have to do whatever I need to use any connectivity I have, including mobile data and the study room at my condo. It's awful but needed.

PROB: I have all the lists downloaded too, and a printed book to study, this must to be enough. Study like the old mans.

ATAL: Must to download all material I can, and divide the time with concurrent at the study room to do the lists from codeforces.

SECURITY AND NETWORK: the most easy of all, just do the test online first of all things before enter hard in ATAL and concurrent.
