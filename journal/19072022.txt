Today, 19/07/2022, I Learned...

9h16: not so much (yet), but I realized I'm in a little trouble with myself. Nothing is compromised or certain danger, but if I keep doing the things the way I'm doing last days, it will become an unnecessary problem.
Here's my schedule for today:

- At morning: Study Prob. Redo some exercises I did not gave  all the attention it needs, and start the exercises I didn't
- At afternoon: Concurrent programming class; then I'll do a picture of all the stuff I have to do to next week tests, such as Prob and (maybe) Concurrent programming.
- At evening: come back here and describe my successes of the day. Then, do some Linux exercises just to keep me in action, but just a little bit, then back to Prob or Concurrent, depending of the response about the next week.
- Pauses and transition moments: Duolingo.

My point is: Learn something, exercise something, keep the panel known, do some progress, even I think it's not enough, we still have tomorrow, but tomorrow is a day for a new schedule, a new bunch of exercises, not the today's exercises. We can complement what we didn't today, but not do what we had to do today, tomorrow.
