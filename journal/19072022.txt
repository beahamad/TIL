Today, 19/07/2022, I Learned...

9h16: not so much (yet), but I realized I'm in a little trouble with myself. Nothing is compromised or certain danger, but if I keep doing the things the way I'm doing last days, it will become an unnecessary problem.
Here's my schedule for today:

	- At morning: Study Prob. Redo some exercises I did not gave  all the attention it needs, and start the exercises I didn't
	- At afternoon: Concurrent programming class; then I'll do a picture of all the stuff I have to do to next week tests, such as Prob and (maybe) Concurrent programming.
	- At evening: come back here and describe my successes of the day. Then, do some Linux exercises just to keep me in action, but just a little bit, then back to Prob or Concurrent, depending of the response about the next week.
	- Pauses and transition moments: Duolingo.

My point is: Learn something, exercise something, keep the panel known, do some progress, even I think it's not enough, we still have tomorrow, but tomorrow is a day for a new schedule, a new bunch of exercises, not the today's exercises. We can complement what we didn't today, but not do what we had to do today, tomorrow.


17h27: Well, we have some news.
	- Yeah, we'll have tests next week of Concurrent, so we have to organize the time to do the notes for it without compromise the study for Prob.
	- I made some progress at redoing some exercises of Prob. I'm feeling great, some of my lost energy to study this subject are restored, this is a today's victory.
	- An unforeseen happened: we are out of conectivity at home by today (at least, thanks cable robbers) and it will be an issue to my schedule of studies. But I'm compromised to do whatever it needs to do the maximum I can to not let this delay too much of my plans. Tomorrow I'll come back in another journal page to list what was done and what I have to do to put all on the right path.
	- I almost had a narcolepsy episode at Concurrent class, I'm doing wrong to take my medicins to be awaken at night, and I must to take care with it, it can cost my produtivity during the daylight. It's time to put my routine togeder and be more compromised at do all I have to do during the day and sleep well.

If I have connectivity at home, I'll be back and describe my schedule for the next days, if not, we'll see it tomorrow.

STATUS: [VICTORY]
