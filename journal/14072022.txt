Today, 14/07/2022, I learned less than I desired...

4h03 a.m: ...but I realized I learned the amount of 1024 words(!!!) in german in the 62 days I am doing Duolingo lessons. It's quite a thing.
I must to finish my Linux course, it's being a long time I'm helding to give some effort on it, but yesterday I did something at the few time I had in the late afternoon, and it is a thing, it's different of nothing.
I had the balls to register me to compete for a scolarship in Python (!!!<3) to improve my skills, but I don't know yet if I'll be choosen, BUT had the courage and feel confident to enroll, that was an achievement, and must be pointed here as I learned how to surpass my fear of try new things just because the scare of failness. For me it means a lot, more than anything.
